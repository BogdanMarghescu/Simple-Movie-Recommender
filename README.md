# Simple-Movie-Recommender
Simple movie recommender built in GNU Octave, which creates a database of user ratings (100,000 ratings applied to 9,000 movies by 600 users), receives movie ratings from a new user(from 1 to 5, with half-star ratings allowed) and, based on those, gives the user a number of movie recommendations.
